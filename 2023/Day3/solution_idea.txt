Thinking of the textinput as a grid. With a language without an array we ned a way to navigate
the grid. each row will need an row identifier and each value gets a col identifier.

Parse:
Step 1: read the file, we need the whole file as we need to search the previuous and next line.
Step 2: split each row into array. Attach an increment row number.
Step 3: split every character and add a col number to each object

Search:
Start with row 0 and and jump until a number is found.

Verify validity:
When a number is found, look left look right while counting the length. 
IF no symbol on left and right, verify validity on a row above and under on cols -1 to +1

24-01-28:
Code fails since for prev search nums_right(next, col +1) next should only be done if * is at the end
Same for next. if * is at the end we check nums_right(prev, col +1)


final solution for 3b.
The idea is to check from left top to right bottom.
if we have a num * we check above,below and to the right as 1. 
If the star is on the previous row and on on step passed the last pos of the number we check +1 index to the right. 2.
The last "next is adjacent catches the rest of the case where the * is at multiple places and find the next number 
depedning on placement. 3a shows when the * is under/:below the number and all the way left to first index -1
and doesnt check the row above the since that would crash with the org number.
3b: is the case where the star is one pos behind the last number on a row below and all directions are checked.
