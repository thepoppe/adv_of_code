Thinking of the textinput as a grid. With a language without an array we ned a way to navigate
the grid. each row will need an row identifier and each value gets a col identifier.

Parse:
Step 1: read the file, we need the whole file as we need to search the previuous and next line.
Step 2: split each row into array. Attach an increment row number.
Step 3: split every character and add a col number to each object

Search:
Start with row 0 and and jump until a number is found.

Verify validity:
When a number is found, look left look right while counting the length. 
IF no symbol on left and right, verify validity on a row above and under on cols -1 to +1

NOT WORKING:







my answer      = 71065712
my answer      = 78864296
correct answer = 80694070
